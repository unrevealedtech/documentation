# Introduction to Unrevealed

Unrevealed is a workflow based feature management solution for developers who want to deliver more value, and worry less about their feature flags. It enables teams to ship more often with more confidence, and spend less time configuring feature flags and debugging their code.

## Why another tool?

There are tons of feature flag solutions out there, but they're all based on the same principle. You create a flag, then configure rules for each environment, defining who will get what version of your flag.

If you've worked with feature flags, you're probably familiar with the following challenges:

1. Making sense of your feature flags is hard

   Rules can get pretty complex, with user targeting, segment targeting, custom rules, percentage based rollout,â€¦ You have to think about all the ways every rule can affect your features at any time, which quickly becomes overwhelming.

   When trying to consider every environment, it becomes even more complex to create a mental model of the state of a flag.

   And if you're trying to make sense of a bunch of features at the same time, good luck with that.

2. Making changes to rules is error-prone

   Any change you make to your rules, if you're not careful enough, can lead to unwanted behaviors, whether it's disabling a feature for a client in production, or turning on a feature in tests that was expected to be off and breaks your pipeline. This creates unwanted stress for engineers, and is nearly impossible to manage for non-technical people.

### Workflow based approach

Taking a workflow based approach eliminates those problems entirely. In Unrevealed, your features go through stages which dictate what rules can and cannot affect their state. Let's illustrate with an example:

<figure>
  <img src="/img/docs/intro/kanban.png" alt="All features by stage" />
  <figcaption>Features go through stages you can customize</figcaption>
</figure>

In the figure above, we've configured our workflow to have 5 different stages (see [Workflow Configuration](/docs/workflow) to learn how to configure your stages). Each stage dictates which rules are applied or customizable on the features that are currently in it. For example, `Feature A` is currently in the `Released` stage, which means it's enabled to every user in every environment. In this case, the only information you need to understand how this feature behaves is the stage itself.

<figure>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/intro/feature-released.png"
    alt="Workflow feature is released"
  />
  <figcaption>Workflow feature is released</figcaption>
</figure>

`Code Generation`, on the other hand, is in the `Beta` stage. In `Beta`, every feature is enabled all the time in staging and development, and you can specify which users and teams can access it in production. This is designed to reduce the mental load, so you don't have to worry about things that are irrelevant (in this case, the rules that affect a feature in staging and development while it's in beta).

<figure>
  <img src="/img/docs/intro/feature-beta.png" alt="Feature B is in beta" />
  <figcaption>Code generation is in beta</figcaption>
</figure>

Moving a feature from one stage to another affects rules in every environment at the same time. For example, you can turn off a feature completely by moving it to the `Killed` stage.

<figure>
  <img
    src="/img/docs/intro/move-to-killed.gif"
    alt="Moving a feature to the Killed stage disables it in every environment"
  />
  <figcaption>
    Moving a feature to the Killed stage disables it in every environment
  </figcaption>
</figure>

At this point, you should have a basic understanding of what Unrevealed does differently. There are more features that make it a lot easier for developers to work with feature flags, like the [code generator](/docs/code-generator) or the [VS Code extension](/docs/vscode-extension).
