# Introduction to Unrevealed

Unrevealed is the feature management solution for developers who want to deliver more value to their customers, and worry less about their feature flags.

We enable teams to ship more often with more confidence, while spending less time configuring feature flags and debugging their code.

## Why another feature flag tool?

Unrevealed was born out of frustration with existing solutions. Using those products is a headache, and I knew we could do better.

Unrevealed is a tool that you'll actually love using. It integrates into your workflow when appropriate, and gets out of your way the rest of the time.

So, what makes it different?

### Workflow based approach

In Unrevealed, you don't need to think much about the rules that affect every feature. If feature A is in the `Released` stage, it's available for every user in every environment. You don't need to check what rules affect it in each environment, because it's fixed by its current stage.

If feature B is in `Beta`, it's available to a subset of users in production, and to every user in other environments.

You can also completely disable a feature just by moving it to a certain stage.
